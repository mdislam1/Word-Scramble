# Word Scramble Game

## Overview

The **Word Scramble Game** is a GUI-based application built using the `breezypythongui` library. The game selects a random word from a predefined list, scrambles it, and presents it to the user. The user has three attempts to guess the correct word. Points are awarded based on the length of the word, multiplied by 10, for each correct guess. After each round, the user can choose to continue playing or exit the game.

## Features

- **Random Word Selection**: The game selects a random word from a predefined list stored in a text file (`words.txt`).
- **Word Scrambling**: The selected word is scrambled and displayed to the user.
- **User Interaction**: The user can input their guess and check if it matches the original word.
- **Feedback System**: The game provides feedback after each guess, indicating whether the guess was correct or not.
- **Score Tracking**: Points are awarded based on the length of the word, multiplied by 10, for each correct guess.
- **Multiple Attempts**: The user has three attempts to guess the correct word.
- **Continue Option**: After each round, the user can choose to continue playing or exit the game.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `breezypythongui` library
